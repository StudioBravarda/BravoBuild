# BravoBuild

This repository houses a comprehensive build solution for Unity, build to streamline development processes for our team at Bravarda. 
We understand that there are numerous build solutions available for Unity, but our approach addresses specific needs and objectives unique to our project.
If you share any of the key objectives in your own project, feel free to use it and propose changes as well.

# Key Objectives
## Leveraging Odin Inspector
One of the primary motivations behind this project is to incorporate and familiarize ourselves with Odin Inspector. Odin presents a powerful suite of tools that enhance our development workflow in the editor. Integrating Odin into our build process was just the next natural step.

## Enhanced Configurability
Given the diverse skill sets within our team - comprising both programmers and non-programmers - configurability is paramount. Our build solution ensures that settings are easily shareable via version control systems, facilitating seamless collaboration and accessibility for all team members.

## Build Log Preservation
We recognize the importance of preserving build logs as a means of tracking changes and identifying potential issues. Our build system includes a feature to save build logs, allowing for historical comparisons and insights into build size and duration variations over time. The next step is saving this build log to a file so it can be processed by another BravoBuild system to be made.

## Streamlined Deployment to Steam and Itch.io
Deploying builds to platforms such as Steam and Itch.io should be a straightforward and reliable process for every team member. Our build solution offers an intuitive and fail-proof mechanism, empowering anyone with access to a Unity Editor to effortlessly upload builds to these platforms.
